would worthwhile shall talk questioner education questioner lack awareness questioner love questioner sir sometimes due nervous fatigue mind seems lose sensitivity wondering could cope situation krishnamurti could take problem like violence seems spreading world could see implications whether human mind really solve social also inward problems without kind violence one observes every part world revolts revolutions order change social structure obviously structure changed possible change without violence violence begets violence revolt one party assume power government achieved maintain power violence fairly obvious happening throughout world asking whether way bringing change world breed violence thought would serious problem one us would like discuss say questioner yes let discuss violence krishnamurti let us go really deeply superficially talking bear mind must also alter ways life know want go deeply question whether outside world social structure injustice divisions appalling brutality wars revolts rest changed well inward struggle going perpetually changed without violence without conflict without opposition without forming one party opposed another party outwardly also without inward division bearing mind division source conflict violence one bring change outwardly inwardly thought would important issue face say sirs discuss questioner shall start

watch another questioner desire achieve something gain something something want look see much violence knew could give still survive within acceptable limits would first step krishnamurti within acceptable limits may also violent questioner yes would expect still degree violence krishnamurti asking whether possible live without violence say root could understand perhaps would know live without violence root questioner feeling revolution separation krishnamurti say root violence separation division mind live without please go let us enquire questioner true long objective desire kind seed violence krishnamurti course whole point must go step step please sirs go questioner pose question possible live without objective krishnamurti yes possible live without objective without principle without aim without purpose questioner purpose life krishnamurti opposite drift therefore must careful think terms opposite objective drifting must careful say objective form violence objective may drift questioner irrelevant sir whether one drifts question question possible live without violence krishnamurti warning sir go opposite possible live without direction direction means resistance means distraction distortion means continuous drive towards goal want purpose end end goal purpose principle ideal true thing mind invented conditioned afraid seeking security outwardly

intelligence professor bohm intelligence always like look origin word well meaning interesting comes inter legere means read seems could say thought like information book intelligence read meaning think gives rather good notion intelligence krishnamurti read lines bohm yes see means also another relevant meaning given dictionary mental alertness krishnamurti yes mental alertness bohm well different people mind measure intelligence considering many things said would say intelligence thought say thought takes place old brain physical process electrochemical amply proved science thought essentially physical chemical process could say perhaps intelligence order order time krishnamurti intelligence bohm yes intelligence reads lines thought sees meaning one point start question say thought physical mind intelligence whatever want call seems different different order would say real difference physical intelligence krishnamurti yes saying thought matter let us put differently bohm matter would rather call material process krishnamurti right thought material process relationship intelligence intelligence product thought bohm think take granted krishnamurti take granted bohm simply thought mechanical krishnamurti thought mechanical right bohm intelligence krishnamurti thought measurable intelligence happen intelligence comes existence thought relationship intelligence cessation thought awakening intelligence intelligence independent thought time therefore exists always bohm raises many difficult questions krishnamurti know bohm would like put framework thinking one could connect scientific views may exist krishnamurti yes bohm either show fits fit say intelligence may always krishnamurti asking always bohm may may possible something interferes intelligence krishnamurti see hindus theory intelligence brahman exists always covered illusion matter stupidity kinds mischievous things created thought know would go far bohm well yes actually see eternal existence intelligence krishnamurti say peel thing assumption existed always bohm difficulty word always krishnamurti yes bohm always implies time krishnamurti right bohm trouble time thought would like put thought order time perhaps way round time order thought words thought invented time fact thought time way see thought may sweep whole time one moment thought always changing without noticing changing physically physical reasons krishnamurti yes bohm rational reasons krishnamurti bohm reasons something total physical movement brain therefore krishnamurti depend environment kinds things bohm thought changes time meaning longer consistent becomes contradictory changes arbitrary way krishnamurti yes follow bohm begin think everything changing everything changes one realizes time time extended becomes vast past farther back also forward future begin say time essence time conquers everything first child may think eternal begins understand time general view get time essence existence think common sense view also scientific view hard give view intense conditioning stronger even conditioning observer observed krishnamurti yes quite saying thought time thought measurable thought change modify expand intelligence different quality altogether bohm yes different order different quality get interesting impression thought regard time think past future think past becoming future see thought yet one gets impression past future present together movement another way whole pattern moving krishnamurti whole pattern moving bohm picture moves sense moving perpendicular direction direction past future whole movement begin think movement another time krishnamurti quite quite bohm gets back paradox krishnamurti yes intelligence time therefore related thought movement time bohm thought must related krishnamurti asking think unrelated bohm unrelated seems relation sense distinguish intelligent thought unintelligent thought krishnamurti yes requires intelligence recognise unintelligent thought bohm intelligence reads thought relationship krishnamurti let us go slowly bohm thought respond intelligence thought change krishnamurti let us simple thought time thought movement time thought measurable thought functions field time moving changing transforming intelligence within field time bohm well seen one sense thing clear first thought mechanical krishnamurti thought mechanical clear bohm secondly sense movement different direction krishnamurti thought mechanical mechanical move different directions rest intelligence mechanical let put way bohm would like ask question mechanicalness mean krishnamurti right repetitive measurable comparative bohm would say also dependent krishnamurti dependent yes bohm intelligence let us get clear intelligence dependent conditions truth nevertheless seems sense intelligence operate brain healthy krishnamurti obviously bohm sense intelligence seems depend brain krishnamurti quietness brain bohm right depends quietness brain krishnamurti activity brain bohm still relation intelligence brain discussed question many years ago raised idea physics could use measuring instrument two ways positive negative example measure electric current swing needle instrument use instrument called wheatstone bridge reading look null reading null reading indicates harmony balance two sides whole system using instrument negatively non movement instrument sign working right could say brain may used thought positively make image world krishnamurti function thought one functions bohm function thought negative movement indicate non harmony krishnamurti yes non harmony let us proceed intelligence dependent brain come point use word dependent mean bohm several possible meanings may simple mechanical dependence another kind one exist without say depend food exist mean everything think determined eat krishnamurti yes quite bohm propose intelligence depends existence brain indicate non harmony brain anything content intelligence krishnamurti brain harmonious intelligence function bohm question krishnamurti saving function brain hurt bohm intelligence function intelligence therefore seems intelligence requires brain order exist krishnamurti brain instrument bohm indicates harmony disharmony krishnamurti creator bohm krishnamurti let us go slowly bohm brain create intelligence instrument helps intelligence function krishnamurti brain functioning within field time negatively positively intelligence operate movement time must instrument quiet intelligence operate bohm yes would put possibly slightly differently quietness instrument operation intelligence krishnamurti yes right two separate bohm one non quietness instrument failure intelligence krishnamurti right bohm think would useful go back questions tend raised whole scientific philosophical thinking would ask question sense intelligence exists independently matter see people thought mind matter separate kind existence one question comes may relevant think question considered order help make mind quiet consideration questions clearly answered one things disturbs mind krishnamurti see sir say help make mind quiet thought help awakening intelligence means thought matter exercise thought movement thought thought saying quiet order help awakening intelligence movement thought time move ment measurable functioning positively negatively harmoniously disharmoniously field realizing thought may say unconsciously unknowingly would quiet order still within field time bohm yes still projecting krishnamurti projecting capture intelligence take place awaken bohm question time krishnamurti want use words bohm might perhaps say condition awaken non operation thought krishnamurti yes bohm awakening merely condition even ask conditions intelligence awaken even talk condition form thought krishnamurti yes let us agree movement thought direction vertical horizontal action non action still time movement thought bohm yes krishnamurti relationship movement intelligence movement time product thought two meet bohm meet still relation krishnamurti trying find relationship first one thinks relationship one hopes relationship one projects relationship relationship bohm depends mean relationship krishnamurti relationship contact recognition feeling touch bohm well word relationship might mean something else krishnamurti meaning bohm example parallel harmony two two things may related without contact simply harmony krishnamurti harmony mean movement direction bohm might also mean way keeping order krishnamurti order direction depth intensity harmony thought ever harmonious thought movement static thought bohm understand thought abstract static geometry let us say may harmony thought actually moves always contradictory krishnamurti therefore harmony intelligence harmony bohm think see source confusion static products thought seem certain relative harmony harmony really result intelligence least seems mathematics may get certain relative harmony product thought even though actual movement thought mathematician necessarily harmony generally harmony harmony appears mathematics result intelligence krishnamurti proceed sir bohm perfect harmony every form mathematics proved limit call relative krishnamurti yes movement thought harmony relationship intelligence harmony contradictions rest thought relationship bohm would say could entirely without thought krishnamurti would put round way intelligence uses thought bohm right use something disharmonious krishnamurti expression communication using thought contradictory harmonious create things world bohm still must harmony sense done thought described krishnamurti let us go slowly first put words negatively positively intelligence intelligence impossible words thought time measure bohm put words trying point say thought function pointer intelligence contradiction matter krishnamurti right right bohm using content meaning rather pointer points beyond domain time krishnamurti thought pointer content intelligence bohm content points krishnamurti yes put thing entirely differently may say thought barren bohm yes moves yes krishnamurti mechanical rest thought pointer without intelligence pointer value bohm could say intelligence reads pointer pointer nobody see pointer point krishnamurti quite intelligence necessary without thought meaning bohm could say thought intelligent points confused way krishnamurti yes irrelevant way bohm irrelevant meaningless intelligence begins point another way somehow thought intelligence seem fuse common function krishnamurti yes ask action relationship intelligence right bohm yes krishnamurti action relation intelligence carrying action thought necessary bohm yes well thought necessary thought points obviously towards matter seems point ways back towards intelligence well one questions always comes say intelligence matter merely distinction within thing different really separate krishnamurti think separate distinct bohm distinct actually separate krishnamurti mean word separate related connected common source bohm yes common source krishnamurti thought matter intelligence common source long pause think bohm otherwise could harmony course krishnamurti see thought conquered world understand conquered bohm dominates world krishnamurti thought intellect dominates world therefore intelligence little place one thing dominates must subservient bohm one asks know relevant came krishnamurti fairly simple bohm would say krishnamurti thought must security seeking security movement bohm yes krishnamurti intelligence seeking security security idea security exist intelligence intelligence secure seeks security bohm yes come intelligence allowed dominated krishnamurti oh fairly clear pleasure comfort physical security first physical security security relationship security action security bohm illusion security krishnamurti illusion security course bohm could say thought got hand ceased allow orderly ordered general intelligence least stay harmony intelligence began move accord krishnamurti accord bohm seeking security pleasure krishnamurti saying day talking together whole western world based measure eastern world tried go beyond used thought go beyond bohm tried anyway krishnamurti tried go beyond measure exercising thought therefore caught thought security physical security necessary therefore physical existence physical pleasures physical well became tremendously important bohm yes thinking little go back animal instinctive response towards pleasure towards security would right thought comes dazzle instinct produce sorts glamour pleasure security instincts intelligent enough deal complexity thought therefore thought went wrong excited instincts instincts demanded krishnamurti thought really created world illusion miasma confusion put away intelligence bohm well said made brain chaotic noisy intelligence silence brain therefore noisy brain intelligent krishnamurti noisy brain intelligent course bohm well less explains origin thing krishnamurti trying find relationship action thought intelligence everything action inaction relationship intelligence thought produce chaotic action fragmentary action bohm ordered intelligence krishnamurti ordered intelligence way live bohm said krishnamurti fragmented activity activity wholeness activity wholeness intelligence bohm intelligence also understand activity thought krishnamurti yes said bohm would say intelligence understands activity thought thought different operation krishnamurti yes obviously thought created nationalism means security one sees fallacy seeing fallacy intelligence thought creates different kind world nationalism exist bohm yes krishnamurti also division war conflict rest bohm clear intelligence sees falseness going thought free falseness different begins parallel intelligence krishnamurti right bohm begins carry implication intelligence krishnamurti therefore thought place bohm interesting thought never actually controlled dominated intelligence thought always moves light intelligence falseness seen thought moves parallel harmony intelligence krishnamurti right bohm never anything forces thought anything would suggest intelligence thought common origin substance two ways calling attention greater whole krishnamurti yes one see politically religiously psychologically thought created world tremendous contradiction fragmentation intelligence product confusion tries bring order confusion intelligence sees falseness know making clear see one terribly intelligent although one chaotic bohm well ways krishnamurti happening world bohm suppose rather hard understand moment could

thought human wants live different kind life dominated thought thought always functioning measurement comparison conflict asks free order intelligent instrument intelligence bohm obviously krishnamurti bohm thought time essence unintelligence krishnamurti one thinking terms time bohm yes thought projecting sort phantasy intelligence trying achieve krishnamurti therefore would say thought must completely still awakening intelligence movement thought yet awakening bohm clear one level consider thought actually mechanical may seen one level still mechanism continues krishnamurti continues yes bohm instincts pleasure fear intelligence come grips question pleasures fears desires make thought continue krishnamurti yes bohm see always trap concept image partial krishnamurti human would concerned central issue know confused contradictory disharmonious one life possible change intelligence function life live without disharmony pointer direction guided intelligence perhaps religious people instead using word intelligence used word god bohm advantage krishnamurti know advantage bohm use word krishnamurti came primitive fear fear nature gradually grew idea super father bohm still thought functioning without intelligence krishnamurti course recalling said trust god faith god god operate bohm god perhaps metaphor intelligence people generally take metaphor krishnamurti course terrific image bohm yes could say god means immeasurable beyond thought krishnamurti unnameable immeasurable therefore image bohm operate within measurable krishnamurti yes trying convey desire intelligence time created image god image god jesus krishna whatever faith still movement thought one hopes harmony one life bohm sort image total produces overriding desire urge overrides rationality everything krishnamurti heard day archbishops bishops saying jesus matters nothing else matters bohm movement whereby pleasure overrides rationality krishnamurti fear pleasure bohm override proportion established krishnamurti yes trying say see whole world conditioned way bohm yes question hinted world conditioned way take world existing independently thought fallen trap krishnamurti course course bohm whole conditional world result way thinking cause effect way thinking krishnamurti right bohm way thinking disharmony chaos unintelligence krishnamurti listening labour party conference blackpool clever serious double talk thinking terms labour party conservative party say let us get together see best thing human beings bohm capable krishnamurti exercising intelligence bohm well limited framework trouble always people developed technology things terms limited intelligence serving highly unintelligent purposes krishnamurti yes bohm thousands years going course reactions arise problems much big vast krishnamurti really simple extraordinarily simple sense harmony simple function complex field krishnamurti let us go back said source common thought intelligence bohm yes got far krishnamurti source generally attributed philosophical concept say source god using word moment brahman source common central movement divides matter intelligence verbal statement idea still thought find thought bohm raises question find krishnamurti exist exist asking source time movement environmental conditioning bohm question whole division put aside krishnamurti absolutely point bohm time krishnamurti yet still say going exercise thought enters means division understanding whole talking put away altogether bohm sounds like contradiction krishnamurti know put away takes place source ever named instance jewish religious feeling nameable name talk touch look hindus others say thing different way christians trapped word jesus image never gone source bohm complex question may trying synthesize several philosophies hebrew greek oriental krishnamurti want get source thought find yet thought born source also intelligence like two streams moving different directions bohm would say matter also born source generally krishnamurti course bohm mean whole universe source beyond universe krishnamurti course could put way thought energy intelligence bohm matter krishnamurti thought matter mechanical energy intelligence also energy thought confused polluted dividing fragmenting bohm yes multiple krishnamurti polluted divide intelligence intelligence intelligence divisible sprung source energy divided bohm divided krishnamurti physical reasons comfort bohm maintain physical existence part intelligence changed way help maintain physical existence krishnamurti yes bohm developed certain way krishnamurti gone way energy one energy bohm yes different forms energy many analogies although much limited scale physics could say light ordinarily complex wave motion laser made move together simple harmonious way krishnamurti yes reading laser monstrous things going bohm yes using destructively thought may get something good always gets used broader way destructive krishnamurti energy source bohm would say energy kind movement krishnamurti energy moment movement goes field thought bohm clarify notion energy also looked word see based notion work energy means work within krishnamurti work within yes bohm say energy works movement krishnamurti yes thinking yesterday thinking realized source uncontaminated nonmovement untouched thought two born born bohm one necessary survival krishnamurti survival totality wholeness denied put aside trying get sir want find human living world chaos suffering human mind touch source two divisions exist touched source divisions operate without sense division know conveying bohm possible human mind touch source touch source krishnamurti consumed thought cleverness thought movement thought gods meditations everything bohm yes think brings us question life death relates survival one things gets way krishnamurti thought field security desire security created death something separate bohm yes may key point krishnamurti bohm look way thought constructed instrument survival therefore krishnamurti created immortality jesus bohm thought possibly contemplate death tries always projects something else broader point view seems look anybody tries imagine dead still imagining alive looking dead always complicate sorts religious notions seems built thought possibly consider death properly krishnamurti means ending bohm interesting suppose take death body see outwardly organism dies loses energy therefore falls apart krishnamurti really body instrument energy bohm let us say energy ceases imbue body therefore body longer wholeness could say thought also energy ways goes thought body krishnamurti right bohm people often used phrase f mind dies whole thought way putting puzzling first would think thought die krishnamurti quite quite bohm saying mind dies energy dies thought nearest see means thought working invested certain energy mind intelligence thought longer relevant energy goes thought body krishnamurti right bohm hard mind accept comparison thought organism seems poor thought insubstantial organism substantial death organism appears something far death thought point clear would say death thought essence death organism well krishnamurti obviously bohm although small scale nature krishnamurti said energy thought movement energy thought see die bohm way imagining projecting conceiving death krishnamurti therefore escapes death bohm well gives illusion krishnamurti illusion course created illusion immortality state beyond death projection desire

october conversation david bohm intelligence bohm intelligence always like look origin word well meaning interesting comes inter legere means read seems could say thought like information book intelligence read meaning think gives rather good notion intelligence krishnamurti read lines bohm yes see means also another meaning given dictionary mental alertness krishnamurti yes mental alertness bohm well different people mind measure intelligence considering many things said would say intelligence thought say thought takes place old brain physical process taking place electrochemical amply proved science thought essentially physical chemical electrical process could say perhaps intelligence order order time krishnamurti intelligence bohm yes intelligence reads thought sees meaning thought could start question one point said essential old brain see limits stays within limits make trouble course thought tends keep worrying question unless deeply seen question meaning thought may keep think one questions arises say thought physical mind intelligence whatever want call seems different different order would say real difference physical intelligence krishnamurti yes saying thought matter let us put differently bohm matter would rather call material process krishnamurti right thought material process relationship intelligence intelligence product thought bohm raises many question think would important science krishnamurti intelligence product thought bohm well think take granted krishnamurti take granted bohm simply thought mechanical krishnamurti thought mechanical right bohm intelligence krishnamurti thought measurable intelligence happen intelligence comes existence thought relationship intelligence cessation thought awakening intelligence intelligence independent thought therefore time exists always bohm raises many difficult questions krishnamurti know bohm would like put framework thinking one could connect scientific views may exist krishnamurti yes bohm either show fits fit say intelligence may always krishnamurti asking always bohm may may possible something interferes intelligence krishnamurti see buddhists hindus theory right ancient hindus intelligence brahman exists always covered illusion matter idiocy kinds mischievous things created thought know would go far bohm well yes actually see eternal existence intelligence krishnamurti say peel thing assumption existed always bohm difficulty word always krishnamurti yes bohm always implies time krishnamurti right bohm trouble time thought would like put thought order time perhaps way round time order thought words thought invented time fact thought time way see thought may sweep whole time one moment thought always changing without noticing changing physically physical reasons krishnamurti yes bohm rational reasons krishnamurti bohm reasons something total physical movement brain therefore krishnamurti depend environment kinds things bohm thought changes time meaning longer consistent becomes contradictory changes arbitrary way krishnamurti yes follow bohm begin think everything changing change everything changes one begins think time time extended becomes vast past back also forward future begin say time essence time conquers everything first child may think eternal begins understand time general view get time essence existence think common sense view also scientific view hard give view intense conditioning stronger even conditioning observer observed krishnamurti yes quite saying thought time thought measurable thought change modify expand intelligence different quality altogether bohm yes different order different quality get impression thought regard time think past future think past becoming future see thought yet one gets impression past future present together movement another way whole pattern moving krishnamurti whole pattern moving bohm picture moves words moving perpendicular direction direction past future first sight begin think movement another time krishnamurti quite quite bohm gets back paradox krishnamurti yes intelligence time therefore related thought movement time bohm still thought must related krishnamurti asking think unrelated bohm unrelated first sight seems relation sense distinguish intelligent thought unintelligent thought krishnamurti yes requires intelligence recognize unintelligent thought bohm intelligence reads thought relationship krishnamurti let us go slowly bohm thought respond intelligence thought change krishnamurti let us simple thought time thought movement time thought measurable thought functions field time moving changing transforming intelligence within field time bohm well seen one sense thing clear first thought mechanical krishnamurti thought mechanical clear bohm secondly sense movement different time krishnamurti thought mechanical mechanical move different directions rest intelligence mechanical let put way bohm would like ask question mechanicalness mean krishnamurti right repetitive measurable comparative bohm would say also dependent krishnamurti dependent yes bohm intelligence let us get clear intelligence dependent condition truth seems sense intelligence operate brain healthy krishnamurti obviously bohm sense intelligence seems depend brain krishnamurti quietness brain bohm right depends quietness brain krishnamurti activity brain bohm still relation intelligence brain understand discussed question many years ago raised idea physics could use measuring instrument two ways positive negative like electric current measure electric current swing needle instrument use called wheatstone bridge reading look null reading null reading indicates harmony balance two sides whole system using instrument negatively non function instrument sign working right could say brain may used thought positively make image world krishnamurti function thought one functions bohm function thought negative indicate non harmony krishnamurti yes non harmony let us proceed intelligence dependent brain come point use word dependent mean bohm several possible meanings may simple mechanical dependence another kind one exist without say depend food exist mean everything think determined eat krishnamurti yes quite bohm propose intelligence depends existence brain indicate non harmony brain anything content intelligence krishnamurti brain harmonious intelligence function bohm question krishnamurti saying function brain hurt bohm intelligence function intelligence therefore seems intelligence requires brain order exist krishnamurti brain instrument bohm indicates harmony disharmony krishnamurti creator bohm krishnamurti let us go slowly bohm brain create intelligence instrument helps intelligence function krishnamurti brain functioning within field time negatively positively way movement movement time intelligence operate must instrument quiet intelligence operate bohm yes would put possibly slightly differently quietness instrument operation intelligence krishnamurti yes right two separate bohm one non quietness instrument failure intelligence krishnamurti right bohm think would useful go back questions tend raised whole scientific philosophical thinking would ask question sense intelligence exists independently matter see people thought mind matter separate kind existence one question comes may relevant think question considered one way another order help make mind quiet consideration questions clearly answered one things disturbs mind krishnamurti see sir say thought help awakening intelligence put way means thought matter exercise thought movement thought thought saying quiet order awakening intelligence movement thought time movement measurable functioning positively negatively harmoniously disharmoniously field realizing thought may say unconsciously unknowingly would quiet order still within field time bohm yes still projecting krishnamurti projecting capture intelligence take place awaken bohm question time krishnamurti want use words bohm even ask conditions awaken say condition awaken non operation thought krishnamurti yes bohm awakening merely condition even ask conditions intelligence awaken even talk condition form thought krishnamurti yes let us agree movement thought direction vertical horizontal action non action still time movement thought bohm yes krishnamurti relationship movement intelligence movement time product thought two meet bohm meet still relation krishnamurti trying find relationship first one thinks relationship one hopes relationship one projects relationship relationship bohm depends mean relationship krishnamurti relationship contact recognition feeling touch bohm well word relationship might mean something else krishnamurti meaning bohm example parallel harmony two two things may related without contact simply harmony krishnamurti harmony mean movement direction bohm might also mean way keeping order krishnamurti order order direction depth intensity harmony thought ever harmonious thought movement static thought bohm understand thought abstract static geometry let us say may harmony thought actually moves always contradictory krishnamurti therefore harmony intelligence harmony bohm think see source confusion static products thought seem certain relative harmony harmony really result intelligence least seems mathematics may get certain relative harmony product thought even though actual movement thought mathematician necessarily harmony generally harmony harmony appears mathematics result intelligence krishnamurti proceed sir bohm perfect harmony every form mathematics proved limit call relative krishnamurti yes bohm want go say much thought action another phase question time action generally general also seem need time chronological time action least harmony seems krishnamurti said sir thought movement movement harmony relationship harmony therefore contradiction change rest relationship bohm would say could entirely without thought krishnamurti would put round way intelligence uses thought bohm right use something disharmonious krishnamurti sense expression communication using thought contradictory harmonious create things world bohm still must harmony sense done thought described krishnamurti let us go slowly first put words negatively positively intelligence intelligence impossible words thought time measure rest bohm put words trying point say thought function pointer intelligence contradiction matter krishnamurti right right bohm using content meaning rather pointer points beyond domain time krishnamurti thought pointer content intelligence bohm content points krishnamurti yes put thing entirely differently may say thought barren bohm yes moves yes krishnamurti mechanical rest thought pointer without intelligence pointer value bohm could say intelligence reads pointer pointer nobody see pointer point krishnamurti quite intelligence necessary without meaning bohm could say thought without intelligence points confused way krishnamurti yes confused irrelevant ways bohm irrelevant meaningless intelligence begins point another way somehow thought intelligence seem fuse common function krishnamurti yes asking action relationship intelligence right bohm yes krishnamurti action relation intelligence carrying action thought necessary bohm yes well thought necessary thought points obviously towards matter seems point ways back towards intelligence well one questions always comes say intelligence matter merely distinction thing different really separate seems ought distinction thing krishnamurti think separate distinct bohm distinct actually separate krishnamurti mean word separate related connected common source bohm yes common source krishnamurti thought matter intelligence common source long pause think bound bohm otherwise could harmony course krishnamurti see thought conquered world understand conquered bohm dominates world krishnamurti thought intellect dominates world therefore intelligence little place one thing dominates must subservient bohm one asks know relevant came krishnamurti fairly simple bohm would say krishnamurti would say thought must security seeking security movement bohm yes krishnamurti intelligence seeking security security idea security exist intelligence intelligence secure seeks security bohm yes one could also consider question come intelligence allowed dominated krishnamurti oh fairly clear pleasure comfort physical security first physical security security relationship security action security bohm kind illusion security krishnamurti illusion security course bohm could say thought got hand ceased allow orderly ordered general intelligence least ceased stay harmony intelligence began move accord krishnamurti accord bohm seeking security pleasure krishnamurti saying day talking together whole western world based measure eastern world tried go beyond used thought go beyond bohm tried anyway krishnamurti tried go beyond measure exercising thought therefore caught thought security physical security necessary therefore physical existence physical pleasures physical well became tremendously important bohm yes thinking little go back animal instinctive response towards pleasure security would right thought comes dazzle instinct produce sorts glamour pleasure security instincts intelligent enough deal complexity thought therefore thought went wrong excited instincts instincts demanded krishnamurti quite thought really created world illusion miasma confusion put away intelligence bohm well said made brain chaotic noisy intelligence silence brain therefore noisy brain intelligent krishnamurti noisy brain intelligent quite right bohm well less explains origin thing krishnamurti trying find relationship action thought intelligence everything action inaction relationship intelligence thought produce chaotic action fragmentary action bohm ordered intelligence krishnamurti course ordered intelligence way live bohm said krishnamurti fragmented activity therefore activity wholeness activity wholeness intelligence bohm intelligence also understand activity thought krishnamurti yes said bohm would say intelligence understands activity thought thought different operation krishnamurti yes obviously thought created nationalism means security one sees fallacy seeing fallacy intelligence thought creates different kind world nationalism exist bohm yes krishnamurti therefore division conflict war rest bohm clear intelligence sees falseness going falseness stops thought free falseness different begins parallel intelligence krishnamurti right bohm begins carry implication intelligence krishnamurti therefore thought place bohm interesting could say thought never actually controlled dominated intelligence thought always moves light intelligence falseness seen thought moves parallel harmony intelligence krishnamurti right bohm thought never anything forces anything would suggest intelligence thought common origin substance two ways calling attention greater whole krishnamurti yes sir one see politically religiously psychologically thought created world tremendous contradiction fragmentation intelligence product confusion tries bring order confusion intelligence sees falseness know making clear see terribly intelligent although chaotic bohm well ways krishnamurti happening world bohm suppose rather hard understand moment could say limited sphere seems intelligence able operate outside krishnamurti concerned living theories theories insight one concerned life intelligence operates intelligence time measure product movement thought order thought human wants live different kind life dominated thought thought always functioning measurement comparison conflict asks free order intelligent instrument intelligence bohm obviously krishnamurti bohm thought time essence unintelligence krishnamurti one thinking terms time bohm yes thought projecting sort phantasy intelligence trying achieve krishnamurti therefore would say thought must completely still awakening movement thought yet awakening bohm clear one level consider thought actually mechanical may seen one level still mechanism continues krishnamurti continues yes bohm instincts pleasure fear intelligence therefore come grips question pleasures fears desires make thought continue krishnamurti yes bohm see always trap form concept image partial krishnamurti course human would concerned know confused contradictory disharmonious one life possible change intelligence function life live without disharmony pointer direction guided intelligence see sir religious people instead using word intelligence used word god bohm advantage krishnamurti know advantage bohm use word krishnamurti came primitive fear fear thunder fear nature gradually grew idea super father bohm still brain functioning krishnamurti course saying said trust god faith god god operate bohm sort metaphor said god intelligence people take metaphor krishnamurti course terrific image bohm yes could say god means immeasurable beyond thought krishnamurti unnameable immeasurable therefore image bohm operate within measurable krishnamurti yes trying convey desire intelligence time created image god image god jesus krishna whatever faith still movement thought hope way harmony life bohm sort image total produces overriding desire urge overrides rationality krishnamurti overrides rationality everything bohm everything krishnamurti heard day archbishops bishops saying sounded ridiculous jesus matters nothing else matters bohm movement whereby pleasure overrides rationality krishnamurti course course fear pleasure bohm override proportion established krishnamurti yes trying say see whole world conditioned way bohm yes question hinted world conditioned way take world objectively existent fallen trap krishnamurti course course bohm whole world result way thinking cause effect way thinking krishnamurti right bohm way thinking disharmony chaos unintelligence krishnamurti listening labour party conference blackpool interesting clever serious double talk thinking terms labour party conservative party say look let us get together see best thing marvellous thing human beings bohm capable krishnamurti exercising intelligence bohm well limited framework trouble always people developed technology weapons things terms limited intelligence serving highly unintelligent purposes krishnamurti yes bohm thousands years going course think reaction tends arise like much big krishnamurti yes bohm words vast thing time space krishnamurti really simple extraordinarily simple sense harmony simple function complex field let us go back said source common thought intelligence bohm yes got far krishnamurti source bohm well would beyond krishnamurti wait minute sir let see source generally attribute philosophical concept say source god using word moment jehovha brahman source common central movement divides matter intelligence verbal statement idea still thought therefore find thought bohm raises question find krishnamurti exist exist asking source time movement environmental conditioning bohm question whole division put aside krishnamurti absolutely point bohm time krishnamurti yet still say going exercise thought enters division deliberately understanding whole talking put away altogether bohm sounds like contradiction

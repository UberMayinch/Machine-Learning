a) Let's find the probability that the plane fails to complete a four-hour flight due to engine failure. Since the two engines operate independently, and the plane can fly on only one engine, the only way that it will be unable to complete the journey is if both engines fail simultaneously.

Let $p $ be the probability of an engine failing in a four-hour flight. Since each engine has a 1% chance of failing, $ p = 0.01 $.


$
\mathbb P(\text{both engines failing simultaneously}) = (0.01)\times(0.01) = 10 ^ {-4} \text{ or } 0.01\%
$

b) To find the probability that at least two people have the same birthday in a room of 30 people, we can use the complement rule. That is, we find the probability that no two people have the same birthday and subtract it from 1.

The probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 1. The probability that the second person has a different birthday from the first is $ \frac{364}{365} $, since there are 364 days left in a non-leap year. Similarly, the probability that the third person has a different birthday from the first two is $ \frac{363}{365} $, and so on.

So, the probability that all 30 people have different birthdays is:

$$
\frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \frac{363}{365} \times \ldots \times \frac{336}{365}
$$

Therefore, the probability that at least two people have the same birthday is:

$$
1 - \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \frac{363}{365} \times \ldots \times \frac{336}{365}
$$

This may be represented as

$$ 1 - \frac{^nP_k}{(365)^{n}}$$
here, n = 30.
These formulas represent the probabilities for the given scenarios.

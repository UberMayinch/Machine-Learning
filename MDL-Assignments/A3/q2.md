To derive the recursion for $ q_n $, let's consider the possibilities after $ n $ tosses:

1. If the $ n^{th}$ toss results in a head, then there have been $ (n-1) $ tosses with an even number of heads.
2. If the $ n^{th}$ toss results in a tail, then there have been $ (n-1) $ tosses with an odd number of heads.

Let $ q_n $ represent the probability of having an even number of heads after $ n $ tosses. We can express $ q_n $ as the sum of two probabilities:

1. The probability of having an odd number of heads after $ n-1 $ tosses and then getting a head on the $ n $th toss.
2. The probability of having an even number of heads after $ n-1 $ tosses and then getting a tail on the $ n $th toss.

Mathematically:

$$ q_n = (1-p) \cdot q_{n-1} + p \cdot (1 - q_{n-1}) $$

Expanding this equation:

$$ q_n = (1-p) \cdot q_{n-1} + p - p \cdot q_{n-1} $$

Simplifying:

$$ q_n = p + (1 - 2p) \cdot q_{n-1} $$

This is the recursion relating $ q_n $ to $ q_{n-1} $.

To solve this recursion, cancel the terms in a telescoping manner after multiplying both sides by (1-2p)

$$ q_{n-1}-p = (1 - 2p) \cdot q_{n-2} $$
$$ q_{n-2}-p = (1 - 2p) \cdot q_{n-3} $$
$$ q_{n-3}-p = (1 - 2p) \cdot q_{n-4} $$
$$ \vdots $$
$$ q_{1}-p = (1 - 2p) \cdot q_{0} $$
$$ \implies q_n=(1-2p)^n \cdot (q_0-\frac{1}{2})$$

But due to the requirements stated in the question, the value of $q_0$ is 1.

Thus, the solution is:

$$ q_n = \frac{1 + (1 - 2p)^n}{2} $$

This completes the solution.
